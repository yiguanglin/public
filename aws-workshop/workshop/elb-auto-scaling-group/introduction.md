# Add an extra EC2 instance with ELB and auto-scaling

In this section we want to add an extra EC2 instance to be able to manage a bigger amount of trafic and improve our performance.

To do that we are going to add also a [ELB](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) that is going to be the one in charge of distribute the traffic accross our instances.

Also we will add an [auto-scaling group](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/autoscaling/) with 2 availability zones.
This way we ensure that if we have 2 instances one on each availability zone, and an [Availability Zone](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-regions-availability-zones) goes down and our instance terminated, AWS will automatically start a new instance in the other availability zone so we don't decrease our performance.
Also we will create some rules to add more instances if our 2 instances are overloaded (example: using 80% of cpu for the last 5 minutes), you can add whatever rule you want.
