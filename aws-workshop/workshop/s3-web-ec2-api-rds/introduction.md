# Introduction

We are ready to start the deployment of our website.

The first step will be the frontend. Because itâ€™s a static website, we can create an [S3 bucket](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html), put all the code in it and serve it as a static website. Think of an S3 bucket as a folder in the cloud, which can be setup for access from the outside world via a URL (and even help a bit with your application's routes).

To automate the build, we will use [CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/), AWS service to build projects on the go.
CodeBuild will pull our repository, build the webpage and copy the build directory to S3. The configuration is specified on `buildspec.frontend.yml` on [the root folder of our repo](/buildspec.frontend.yml).

In order to automate the deployment of our API to the EC2 instances, we will use [CodeDeploy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/welcome.html). It will pull our repo to the EC2 instances and start our server (gunicorn). The full deploy process is described in the `appspec.yml` file, [here](/appspec.yml).

Last but not least our database will be hosted using [AWS RDS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html), as a PostgreSQL instance.

To sum up, in this section we will create:

- an S3 bucket to host our static frontend.
- a CodeBuild setup to build the frontend and copy the output to the S3 bucket.
- a CodeDeploy setup to deploy our API to the EC2 instances.
- a RDS PostgreSQL instance.

> **Important:** after you are done with this workshop, you will ideally clean up your account, so you are not billed anymore. This means that you need to delete everything you have created.
>
> Many resources in AWS [can be tagged](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/aws-tagging-strategies/). If something can be tagged, then you should tag it with a **unique name**. Later, you can use the [Tag Editor](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/resource-groups-and-tagging/) to find your tagged resources to delete, and make sure you don't leave anything behind.
