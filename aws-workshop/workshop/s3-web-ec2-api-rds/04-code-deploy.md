# CodeDeploy

[CodeBuild](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/welcome.html) is a service to automate the deployment of any kind of applications to EC2 instances. The configuration is really simple and easy to adapt. The deployment process is described in an `appspec.yml` file like [this one](/appspec.yml). If you want to know what happens during the deploy, you can also check the implementation of the hooks [here](/infrastructure/aws/codedeploy).

First, we need to create a default role for CodeDeploy so it can have access to other AWS services (like S3).

## Create CodeDeploy Role
1. Go to **IAM** under **Security, Identity & Compliance**.
2. Go to **Role** section and click **Create Role**.
3. Select **CodeDeploy** for both service and use case and click **Next: Permissions**.
4. Select **Next: Tags**.
5. Select **Next: Review**.
6. Type a name and description and click **Create Role**.

Now we are ready to start using it.

##  Configure Code Deploy
1. Go to **CodeDeploy** under **Developer Tools**.
2. Go to **Applications** and click **Create application**.
3. Enter an **Application name** and **EC2/On-premises** on **Compute platform** then click **Create Application**.
4. Click on **Create Deployment group** and enter a Deployment Group name.
5. On **Service role** select the role created to grant CodeDeploy access to the instances.
6. Select **In-place** on **Deployment Type** section.
7. Check **Amazon EC2 instances** in **Environment Configuration**, then on the first tag group select `environment` as Key and as Value `prod`, on the second line select `service` as Key and as Value `api`. This means that CodeDeploy will deploy our application to all the EC2 instances with those tags.
8. On **Deployment settings** select **CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime** in Deployment Configurations.
9. Under **Load Balancer** uncheck **Enable load balancing**
10. Click **Create deployment group**

Now our CodeDeploy application is ready. Letâ€™s try our first deployment.

1. On the deployment group details of the group we just made, click **Create Deployment**
2. On **Repository type** select **"My application is stored in GitHub"**.
3. In **Connect to GitHub** section type your GitHub account and select **Connect to GitHub**.
4. Allow AWS to access your GitHub account, if needed.
5. Enter your repository name in the form _account/repository_.
6. In **Commit ID** type the commit hash that you want to deploy.
7. Select **Overwrite the content** below.
8. Click **Create Deployment**.

During the deploy try **View instances** and then **View events** to follow the progress and see what's happening.

**Extra mile:** once the deploy finishes:

- Try hitting the API with something like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or [httpie](https://httpie.org/).
- What effect did the deploy have? Where did all the Python code end up? Is the API connected with the RDS already? `ssh` in to get all those answers, and more.

**Next:** we are going to [finish our first deploy](/workshop/s3-web-ec2-api-rds/05-finishing-up.md), only some extra parameters are missing!
