# Finishing up

As usual, the last steps are modifying our CodeDeploy project so it uses our new Auto Scaling Group, re-run the deploy and rebuild the web so it uses the new parameters.

For this, you can repeat the steps outlined [here](/workshop/elb-auto-scaling-group/03-finishing-up.md#modify-the-codedeploy-project).
